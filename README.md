# Building QR mosaic

This work is based on https://github.com/almaan/diceconverter.

## Workflow

This requires an input json file with QR data/configs. The mosaic is built as follows:

- run `qr_creator.py` with the described json file
- run `qr_mosaic.py` to create the mosaic with created QR codes (i.e. images)
